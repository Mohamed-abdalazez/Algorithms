#### ArrayList & Resizable Arrays

> 1.  **Definition**
>
>     - When you need an array like data structure that offers dynamic resizing, you would usually use ArrayList.
>
>     - ArrayList 𐃘 is an array that resizes itself as needed while still providing O(1) access.
>
>     - when the array is full, the array doubles in size, each doubling takes O(n) time, but happems so rarely that its amortized insertion time is still o(1).
>
> 2.  **Code**
>
>     - There is a simple example implemented in the main.cpp file that is attached.
>
> 3.  **Why is the amortized insertion runtime O(1)?**
